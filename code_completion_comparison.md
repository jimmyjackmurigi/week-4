# Code Completion Comparison

**Manual Implementation:**
```python
def sort_dicts(data, key):
    return sorted(data, key=lambda x: x[key])
```

**Copilot Suggestion:**
Similar function was generated with comments and key validation.

**Conclusion:**
Copilot's version was slightly more verbose but added helpful inline comments.
Manual code is more efficient, but Copilot helps speed up the writing process.
