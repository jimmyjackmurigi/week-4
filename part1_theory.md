# Part 1: Theoretical Analysis

## Q1: GitHub Copilot – Benefits & Limitations

**Benefits:**
- Autocompletes functions and entire code blocks.
- Reduces boilerplate coding.
- Learns from context, improving productivity.

**Limitations:**
- Can produce insecure or incorrect code.
- May suggest outdated patterns.
- Doesn’t understand intent or business logic deeply.

## Q2: Supervised vs Unsupervised in Bug Detection

- **Supervised Learning**: Needs labeled bug data (e.g., "bug" or "no bug").
  - Good for predicting known bug patterns.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Clusters unusual code behavior.
  - Useful when bug data is unavailable (detects anomalies).
