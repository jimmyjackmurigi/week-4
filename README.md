## 📚 Part 1: Theoretical Analysis

### ✅ Topics Covered
- Benefits and limitations of AI code generation (e.g., GitHub Copilot)
- Supervised vs Unsupervised learning for bug detection
- Importance of bias mitigation in user experience personalization
- Case study: AIOps and its role in improving DevOps efficiency
